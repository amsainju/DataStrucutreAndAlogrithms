Singly Linked List Extra Materials: to try

1. Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists
My Appraoch:
	- loop through each element of one linked list
	and create a hash table using unordered_set say elem_set
	- loop through each element of second linked list
	and check if the element are in the elem_set? if yes
	push the data to new linkedlist
	
	- use one loop 
	- add the element on one linked list to the elem_set
	until it the last element added is greater than the current 
	element in second linkedlist.
	MAX_L1  ...
	
2. QuickSort on Linked List
